  Creates or adapts a Canonical 12-factor rock while staying inside the
  Rockcraft extension contract. Validates framework-specific rock fit, keeps
  edits minimal, preserves extension boundaries, and guides build and registry
  push work.
  WHEN: create rockcraft yaml, adapt existing rock, validate rock contract, run
  rockcraft init, inspect expand-extensions, add migration entrypoint, define
  worker or scheduler service, push OCI image to registry, create a rock for a
  12-factor application.

# 12factor Rock

Stay inside the extension. If the repo only works after replacing the extension, stop.

## Skill Order

- Run `$12factor-fit` first when possible.
- Run this skill before `$12factor-juju-terraform`.
- This skill and `$12factor-charm` can proceed independently once the fit
  verdict, framework, and target context are clear.

## Workflow

1. Reuse the fit verdict from `$12factor-fit` if available. If not, inspect the repo and confirm the framework yourself.
2. Run `scripts/check_rock_contract.py <repo> --framework <framework>` before generating anything.
3. Load `references/framework-rock-contracts.md` for the exact project contract of the chosen framework.
4. If the framework is FastAPI, Go, ExpressJS, or Spring Boot, verify the user
   accepted the experimental extension path and that `rockcraft` is on an edge
   channel with `ROCKCRAFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXTENSIONS=true`.
5. If the repo clearly separates frontend and backend in a monorepo, confirm
   the backend subdirectory is the target scope before running `rockcraft init`.
   Do not default to one combined image for that repo shape.
6. If the repo has a frontend or static-asset build step, ask the user
   explicitly whether it should run inside this rock build or remain a separate
   deployment concern. Do not decide that on your own.
7. If the project does require a frontend build inside the same rock, prefer a
   Rockcraft plugin-backed build part when the frontend is a distinct build
   unit. Only use shell steps inside an extension-owned part when the frontend
   is already part of the same runtime application surface.
8. If the app needs database migrations, prefer a root `migrate.sh` for Flask,
   FastAPI, ExpressJS, and Go when the repo does not already provide a
   supported migration entrypoint. For Django, remember current
   `paas-charm` code uses `manage.py migrate` whenever `manage.py` exists, so a
   new `migrate.sh` will not replace that path. For Spring Boot, prefer
   framework-managed migrations unless the repo already exposes a compatible
   wrapper.
9. If the app needs extra background services, add `rockcraft.yaml` services
   whose names end in `-worker` or `-scheduler`, using repo-backed or
   user-confirmed commands only.
10. Run the exact profile from `references/framework-rock-contracts.md`, for
   example `rockcraft init --profile fastapi-framework`. Always use this
   command to generate `rockcraft.yaml` — never copy from templates,
   previously generated files, or example rocks.
11. Inspect the generated `rockcraft.yaml`.
12. Run `rockcraft expand-extensions` before making non-trivial edits.
13. If you add or override Pebble services, inspect the effective expanded
    service command, user, and working directory before packing.
14. If the service runs as a non-root user such as `_daemon_`, verify any file
    or directory the app may create, rewrite, or persist at startup is
    writable by that runtime user, or relocate that mutable state to a more
    appropriate writable path.
15. If the application binary is a multi-command CLI, make the Pebble service
    command invoke the actual long-running subcommand (`server`, `worker`,
    etc.) instead of the bare top-level CLI.
16. Keep edits inside extension-owned parts and the minimal metadata fields described in `references/allowed-edits.md`.
17. Build with `rockcraft pack`. Do not use `--destructive-mode`; if the normal
    Rockcraft build path is blocked, stop and ask before bypassing confinement.
18. If `rockcraft pack` fails on `base: bare`, first try a supported Ubuntu
    base from `references/framework-rock-contracts.md` before making deeper
    dependency changes. Only move into dependency surgery after that base trial
    fails or is not allowed for the framework.
19. Push the result to the user-selected registry only after the target registry has been preflighted, using Rockcraft-shipped tooling when available.

## Allowed Changes

- set name, summary, description, version, and platforms
- add build or stage packages the app truly needs
- add required staged files the extension does not already include
- tune extension-owned parts
- add a root `migrate.sh` when the app needs database migrations and the repo
  does not already expose a supported entrypoint
- add `rockcraft.yaml` services ending in `-worker` or `-scheduler` when the
  app needs background services alongside the main web service
- add a small repo-backed startup wrapper or entrypoint shim in the workload
  image when the app needs a minimal bridge from fixed `paas-charm` env names
  to its existing runtime contract
- adjust ownership or mode of runtime-mutated files or directories inside
  extension-owned parts when the workload runs as a non-root user and needs
  write access at startup
- run frontend builds or static-asset preparation steps in the rock build when
  the application requires them and the user explicitly confirmed that choice
- add a dedicated plugin-backed frontend build part when the frontend is a
  distinct build unit inside the same application scope after the user
  explicitly confirmed that same-image path
- when `base: bare` build fails, try a supported Ubuntu base before deeper
  dependency changes
- move `build-base` to an older supported Ubuntu release when `base: bare`
  allows it and the failure is interpreter compatibility

## Disallowed Changes

- do not rewrite the rock from `expand-extensions` output
- do not create a bespoke manual rock as a silent fallback
- do not generate `rockcraft.yaml` by copying from templates, previously generated files, or example rocks — always use `rockcraft init --profile <framework>`
- do not default to bundling clearly separated frontend and backend monorepos
  into one image
- do not widen the staged file set unless the extension contract actually requires it
- do not choose embedded frontend/static builds without explicit user
  confirmation
- do not upgrade app dependencies before trying an older supported `build-base` for Python framework rocks
- do not jump straight into dependency upgrades or deep dependency edits on a
  `base: bare` failure before trying a supported Ubuntu base
- do not invent worker or scheduler commands without repo evidence or a
  user-confirmed handoff
- do not add a duplicate migration path when the framework already manages it
  and the intended repo behavior is clear
- do not move static-asset or frontend build work into the charm when it can be
  done at rock build time
- do not reach for external container tooling to move the rock if Rockcraft
  already ships the required OCI tooling
- do not use `rockcraft pack --destructive-mode` as a fallback; stop and ask if
  the standard build path is not viable

## Framework Rules

Use `references/framework-rock-contracts.md` every time. The important differences are:

- Flask and Django are Gunicorn-based
- FastAPI is Uvicorn-based
- ExpressJS requires `app/package.json`
- Go is binary-first and uses separate assets staging
- Spring Boot requires one active build system only
- `-worker` and `-scheduler` service names control how 12-factor charms run
  extra services

## Output Contract

Produce:

- a minimal `rockcraft.yaml`
- a clear list of any repo or layout adaptations that were required
- the built rock reference ready for registry push
- the exact rock push command, preferring Rockcraft-shipped `skopeo` when OCI
  copy is required, including `--insecure-policy` when the host has no
  containers policy file
- an explicit note if the repo does not fit the supported extension path
